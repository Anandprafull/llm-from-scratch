Language models (LMs) are a fundamental component of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language by predicting the likelihood of a sequence of words. The evolution of language models has significantly impacted various applications such as chatbots, translation systems, and content generation.
